# kijiji-postal-codes

For mapping Kijiji Ads

Currently scrapes addresses when given a starting URL (e.g. a category page with a list of ads). Addresses can be fed to BatchGeo or a similar service. Goal is to process the output to make this easier, perhaps even generate a map. Use case is parsing garage sales page to find a good neighbourhood to visit on Saturdays.
